<div>Take a journey with us through Taiwan&rsquo;s History of Democratization. Taiwan's history has shaped its political culture into one that longs for democracy and freedom. In order to promote the understanding of Taiwan&rsquo;s struggles in its pursuit of freedom we are taking foreign students on a journey to discover what was sacrificed and what was gained on the road to democracy. On this trip we will visit several sites across Taipei and Yilan that are significant to the establishment of Taiwanese freedom and democracy.<strong><span style="font-size: x-large;"><br />

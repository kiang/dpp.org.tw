	                <p>民主進步黨今(3)日宣布民進黨駐美代表處主任由蕭舜文女士接任，誠摯感謝並恭喜彭光理先生於5月31日榮退，民進黨黨主席賴清德給予最深切的祝福。</p>

<p>民進黨為加強和美方聯繫，於1995年設立駐美代表處，期間幾年曾短暫解編，由2013年於華府重啟，致力於連結台美、促進美國與民進黨的互相瞭解，並積極培育黨內的外交人才。</p>

<p>前任主任彭光理（Michael J. Fonte）自重啟後便掌管代表處至今年五月，他作為民進黨在華府最重要的代言人，多年來為民進黨搭建與美方政策圈、智庫、行政與立法部門的溝通橋樑，在台美關係的發展上厥功至偉，於今年五月底屆齡退休，民進黨主席賴清德於今年二月，彭光理前主任訪台時頒贈終身貢獻獎章，感謝他一生對台灣民主的付出與奉獻。</p>

<p>新任主任蕭舜文為民進黨駐美代表處2013年恢復成立後的首位幕僚，曾協助安排賴清德總統於台南市長任內、蘇貞昌及蔡席英文前主席等黨政高層訪美行程，亦曾參與2016年就職演說及民進黨國防政策藍皮書等專案。自2017年起，蕭舜文任職我國駐美代表處（TECRO）政治組及國會組，熟稔台美關係，並與美行政部門、國會及智庫密切聯繫。其他資歷橫跨政府、NGO及媒體，包括總統府諮議、加州福爾摩沙基金會（Formosa Foundation）計畫主任及天下雜誌記者等。擁有美國喬治城大學（Georgetown University）公共政策碩士、台大新聞所碩士及台大外文系學士。</p>

<p>民進黨借重蕭舜文女士在華府累積多年豐富的工作經驗以及與美方良好的互動關係，期盼其上任後持續推動台美關係深化與各項對台灣有利的外交工作。</p>

The DPP Appoints Iris Shaw as Director of the Democratic Progressive Party Mission in the United States; Thank Michael J. Fonte for Lifelong Dedication</p>

<p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced today (June 3) that Iris Sun-Wen Shaw is appointed as the new director of the DPP&#39;s Mission in the United States, effective in June, 2024. The DPP extends its sincere gratitude and congratulations to Michael J. Fonte, who officially retired on May 31st. DPP Chair Lai Ching-te offers his deepest blessings to both.</p>

<p>The DPP established the U.S. Mission in Washington, DC, to strengthen ties with the United States in 1995. After temporarily closed for a few years, the office was re-established in Washington, D.C. in 2013. The Mission is dedicated to fostering Taiwan-U.S. relations, promoting mutual understanding between the U.S. and the DPP, and actively cultivating diplomatic talent within the party.</p>

<p>Michael J. Fonte, the outgoing director, has been leading the Ｍission since its reopening in 2013 until this May. As the DPP&#39;s most prominent representative in Washington, he has played a pivotal role in building essential communication channels with U.S. policymakers, and think tanks in both Executive and Congressional branches. His contributions to the development of Taiwan-U.S. relations have been invaluable. During Fonte&#39;s visit to Taiwan in February of this year, DPP Chairperson Lai Ching-te awarded him a Lifetime Contribution Medal to honor his lifelong dedication and contributions to Taiwan&#39;s democracy.</p>

<p>The new director, Iris Shaw, was the first staff member of the DPP&#39;s Mission upon its reopening in 2013. She has assisted in arranging visits to the U.S. for high-ranking party officials, including President Lai Ching-te during his tenure as Mayor of Tainan, and former Chairpersons Su Tseng-chang and Tsai Ing-wen. She also participated in projects such as translating for the 2016 inaugural speech and the DPP&#39;s National Defense Policy Blue Paper. Since 2017, Shaw has worked in the political and congressional divisions of Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the U.S., maintaining close contacts with the U.S. government, Congress, and think tanks. Her extensive experience spans from government, NGOs to journalism, including roles as an advisor in Taiwan&rsquo;s Presidential Office, Program Director at the California-based Formosa Foundation, and a journalist for CommonWealth Magazines. She holds a Master&rsquo;s degree in Public Policy from Georgetown University, a Master&rsquo;s in Journalism from National Taiwan University, and a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Foreign Languages and Literatures from National Taiwan University.</p>

<p>The DPP is confident that Iris Shaw&#39;s extensive experience in Washington, D.C., and her excellent interaction with the U.S. will further advance Taiwan-U.S. relations and promote party-oriented diplomatic efforts beneficial to Taiwan.</p>

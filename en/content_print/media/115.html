	                <p>Thank you, Lii Wen and all of you for being here, thanks for the invitation. I must admit that I&#39;ve been spending the last few years far away from Taipei, including some years in in Hualien in the east coast of Taiwan that has recently experienced the earthquake, to the extent that I&#39;ve kind of lost touch with the Taipei NPO scene. But it&#39;s good to be here for the first time at the Impact Foundry and Impact Hub, too.</p>

<p>And I must say that I&#39;m also very impressed by the robustness of NGOs and organizations here in Taipei, not only in the diversity of their presence and the many projects that they were present, but also in the interest in international outreach. And the fact that in recent years, we&#39;ve also welcomed the establishment of many international NGOs and NPOs here in Taiwan as well.</p>

<p>But this occasion is a very special one, I had wanted to get my, well while I was in DC, and I hosted many Ukrainian delegations, I bought myself a blue and yellow dress, just to make a point of where I stand politically, diplomatically. And, unfortunately, the dress is still in the process of shipment to Taiwan, it&#39;s in my cargo that is that has not yet arrived. But the spirit is there.</p>

<p>And this evening&#39;s event, is first in a series of seminars called Island of Resilience that the Department of International Affairs of the DPP is putting together, Lii Wen and Alysa made a very passionate appeal to me to make sure that I would be here tonight. Just to say a few words, I&#39;m not the main show tonight, there are many important delegates from Ukraine, as well as those of you here, who also share a passion for freedom and democracy, who are the main show tonight. But nevertheless, it&#39;s an honor for me to be here to join all of you and acknowledge the importance of this very meaningful partnership, that of the people of Taiwan and the people of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Authoritarianism is a common threat. And I must admit that prior to Russia&#39;s horrible atrocities and aggression, the invasion of Ukraine, the people of Taiwan had very little knowledge and awareness of Ukraine. But since then, we have come to admire the spirit of the Ukrainian people, the resilience and the determination to defend your country&#39;s freedom and a way of life.</p>

<p>Of course, here in Taiwan, we are working to do everything we can to prevent the same tragedies of aggression from happening in our part of the world. But we have much to learn. And I think opportunities like this, dialogues, exchanges between our civil societies is a very good one, to better prepare ourselves, in hardening our resilience, but also in learning how to be strong in connecting internationally to produce the resilience, the International resilience needed to counter the aggressors, who are also allies without limits.</p>

<p>And because of that, it&#39;s all the more important that freedom loving people stand with each other. I know tonight, we have representatives of many Taiwanese NGOs and civil society as well. And I do want to also commend you for your interest in Ukraine and for supporting in many ways, for the growing relationship we have with the people of Ukraine. I think the message of solidarity is an important one in the international context, as the world is also entering into a phase of discussion and debate on our capacities to continue to support Ukraine in the long term.</p>

<p>But I have also made clear that Ukraine&#39;s success is important for Taiwan. Even though we are halfway around the world, I think the people of Taiwan want to see Ukraine succeed, the people of Taiwan are inspired by Ukraine&#39;s resilience. The people of Taiwan also want to be good citizens of the world, and while we seek ways to defend ourselves, we also want to be that force for good in supporting others who are struggling for their freedom for their democracy.</p>

<p>So thank you again for coming. Thanks to all of you. And thanks to the Department of International Affairs for organizing this seminar, I believe it will produce very meaningful discussions that will lay the groundwork for a continuing and growing partnership between our peoples.</p>

<p>But I also want to make a final point and that is this is not only about a relationship between Taiwanese and Ukrainian people, it&#39;s about freedom loving people standing with each other. And in recent years, although we have a very limited governmental relationship with the Ukrainian government, we have worked with other third countries and partners including the governments of Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania in providing aid and support humanitarian aid and support to the Ukrainian people including the building of schools providing clean water medical supplies health etc. And I think this support will continue as the people of Taiwan as I said want to see your continued success. Thank you.</p>

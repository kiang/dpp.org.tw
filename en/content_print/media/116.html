				<h2>DPP Appoints Iris Shaw as Director of the Democratic Progressive Party Mission in the United States</h2>

                <div id="media_contents" class="w80 container">
	                					<hr>
	                <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced today (June 3) that Iris Sun-Wen Shaw is appointed as the new director of the DPP&#39;s Mission in the United States, effective in June, 2024. The DPP extends its sincere gratitude and congratulations to Michael J. Fonte, who officially retired on May 31st. DPP Chair Lai Ching-te offers his deepest blessings to both.</p>

<p>The DPP established the U.S. Mission in Washington, DC, to strengthen ties with the United States in 1995. After temporarily closed for a few years, the office was re-established in Washington, D.C. in 2013. The Mission is dedicated to fostering Taiwan-U.S. relations, promoting mutual understanding between the U.S. and the DPP, and actively cultivating diplomatic talent within the party.</p>

<p>Michael J. Fonte, the outgoing director, has been leading the ï¼­ission since its reopening in 2013 until this May. As the DPP&#39;s most prominent representative in Washington, he has played a pivotal role in building essential communication channels with U.S. policymakers, and think tanks in both Executive and Congressional branches. His contributions to the development of Taiwan-U.S. relations have been invaluable. During Fonte&#39;s visit to Taiwan in February of this year, DPP Chairperson Lai Ching-te awarded him a Lifetime Contribution Medal to honor his lifelong dedication and contributions to Taiwan&#39;s democracy.</p>

<p>The new director, Iris Shaw, was the first staff member of the DPP&#39;s Mission upon its reopening in 2013. She has assisted in arranging visits to the U.S. for high-ranking party officials, including President Lai Ching-te during his tenure as Mayor of Tainan, and former Chairpersons Su Tseng-chang and Tsai Ing-wen. She also participated in projects such as translating for the 2016 inaugural speech and the DPP&#39;s National Defense Policy Blue Paper. Since 2017, Shaw has worked in the political and congressional divisions of Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the U.S., maintaining close contacts with the U.S. government, Congress, and think tanks. Her extensive experience spans from government, NGOs to journalism, including roles as an advisor in Taiwan&rsquo;s Presidential Office, Program Director at the California-based Formosa Foundation, and a journalist for CommonWealth Magazines. She holds a Master&rsquo;s degree in Public Policy from Georgetown University, a Master&rsquo;s in Journalism from National Taiwan University, and a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Foreign Languages and Literatures from National Taiwan University.</p>

<p>The DPP is confident that Iris Shaw&#39;s extensive experience in Washington, D.C., and her excellent interaction with the U.S. will further advance Taiwan-U.S. relations and promote party-oriented diplomatic efforts beneficial to Taiwan.</p>

	                <p>The Department of International Affairs of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hosted the inaugural &quot;Island of Resilience Seminars&quot; on the evening of April 26th in Taipei, with speakers invited from Ukrainian civil society sharing their experiences in Ukraine. Over fifty participants from Taiwan and international civil society, Ukrainian residents in Taiwan, foreign diplomats, academics, and students concerned about Ukraine attended the event. Vice President-elect Bi-khim Hsiao attended the event in person and delivered opening remarks, while Wen Lii, Director of the Department of International Affairs at the DPP, served as the moderator.</p>

<p>The theme of the seminar was &quot;Voices from Ukraine and the International Chorus Against Authoritarianism&quot; Speakers included Ms. Agiya Zahrebelska, head of the sanctions department at the National Agency on Corruption Prevention; Ms. Yevheniia &quot;Jane&quot; Fedotova, Vice President of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine; Ms. Uliana Dzurliak, Chair of Right Room Foundation; and Ms. Mariia Makarovych, Editor of Ukrainian Voices. Through their personal experiences, the four speakers discussed how to strengthen social resilience in response to disasters and threats and how civil society can enhance international cooperation and increase international support.</p>

<p>In her opening remarks, Bi-khim Hsiao extended a welcome to representatives from Ukraine and all participants of the seminar. She expressed her honor to join the seminar and acknowledged the importance of the meaningful partnership between Taiwan and Ukraine. She also commended Taiwanese non-governmental organizations for their contributions to the growing relationship between the Taiwanese people and the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p>Bi-khim Hsiao mentioned that authoritarianism is a common threat faced by the international community. Taiwanese people greatly admire the Ukrainian spirit, where people defend their country&#39;s freedom and way of life with remarkable resilience and determination. She emphasized that Taiwan is strengthening its resilience to prevent a similar tragedy from happening. The seminar provides an excellent opportunity for dialogue and exchange among international civil society, facilitating mutual learning and establishing connections between democratic countries to strengthen resilience against authoritarian aggression, especially since the aggressors are also allies with no limits.</p>

<p>Bi-khim Hsiao reiterated that freedom-loving people should stand together. She also took the opportunity to acknowledge the ongoing concern of Taiwanese non-governmental organizations for Ukraine and their efforts to deepen the relationship between Taiwan and the Ukrainian people through concrete actions. She stated that a message of unity is crucial in the current global geopolitical situation, and Ukraine&#39;s success is vital for Taiwan. Taiwanese people hope to see Ukraine succeed, and Ukraine&#39;s resilience inspires the people of Taiwan. Taiwan aspires to be a force for good, supporting people worldwide struggling for freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>During the seminar, Agiya Zahrebelska recalled past attacks near her home and conveyed the brutality of war to the audience, urging everyone to actively engage in dialogues on strengthening response measures and jointly combating aggression. Yevheniia Fedotova mentioned that perceptions of China in Ukraine have rapidly changed in recent years, as 70% of Ukrainians now consider China a threat to Ukraine&#39;s national security. She also reviewed the efforts of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine in the past few years, especially focusing on issues such as Hong Kong, Myanmar, the Uyghurs, and Taiwan, alongside supporting democracy in Ukraine. She hopes everyone will continue to support democracy and human rights together. Uliana Dzurliak mentioned that many civil society groups in Ukraine have conducted training in first aid and disaster prevention, emphasizing the importance of civil society participation in national defense and strengthening the resilience of communities. Mariia Makarovych stated that the cruelty of war has had a profound impact on Ukrainian culture and language, and shared her experiences to underscore the importance of international cooperation and unity.</p>

<p>Wen Lii, Director of the Department of International Affairs at the DPP, stated that this seminar brought together many partners who share common ideals and principles. He stated that Taiwanese society strongly believes that Taiwan must continue to stand with Ukraine, and that the continued support for human rights and democratic values is a shared goal. Over the past two years, we have seen an outpouring of support for Ukraine among Taiwanese, including both at the government level and from civil society organizations. However, people would like to have more opportunities to learn about Ukraine and to engage with relevant issues. This event is a step forward in promoting more grassroots exchanges, which will create more dialogue between civil society organizations, youth groups, and educational institutions from both sides and strengthen the relationship between Ukraine and Taiwan.</p>

	                <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Diplomatic Empowerment Program delegation, led by DPP Deputy Secretary-General Andrea Yi-shan Yang, conducted a ten-day visit to the United States from July 23 to August 2 and has recently returned to Taiwan successfully. The delegation engaged in extensive dialogues with key figures in Washington, visiting numerous vital institutions and think tanks. The delegation held in-depth and comprehensive discussions with American experts and scholars on a wide range of Taiwan-U.S. relations and international issues, ensuring a thorough understanding and laying a solid foundation for deepening bilateral cooperation.<br />
<br />
The delegation visited the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT/W), Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS), Global Taiwan Institute (GTI), German Marshall Fund (GMF), Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), RAND Corporation, US-Taiwan Business Council, United States Institute of Peace (USIP), American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Heritage Foundation, Hudson Institute, and the National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP), among other organizations. The delegation also met with former U.S. officials.<br />
<br />
The delegation&rsquo;s interactions with these institutions focused on multifaceted areas in Taiwan&rsquo;s strong and vital partnership with the U.S., including peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, semiconductor supply chains, energy transition, information security, economic and trade cooperation, education/culture promotion, and Taiwan&rsquo;s international participation. The delegation also discussed with congressional staff members from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the delegation interacted with the Taiwanese-American community in the Greater Washington area, discussing with members of the Taiwanese Association of America (TAA), the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), and other Taiwanese-American community leaders. The delegation members expressed their profound gratitude for the unwavering support of Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic development by overseas Taiwanese and briefed the community on the recent political developments and challenges in Taiwan.<br />
<br />
Deputy Secretary-General Yang remarked that the delegation members demonstrated high professionalism, exchanging valuable insights with American counterparts. This successful program broadened the delegation members&rsquo; perspectives, providing them with new ideas. Yang hopes that more outstanding young political workers will engage in Taiwan&rsquo;s diplomatic efforts in the future, helping the world better understand Taiwan&rsquo;s positions and sentiments. As Chairperson Lai Ching-te expects, young people in Taiwan should make friends worldwide and continue to cultivate more diplomatic talent.</p>

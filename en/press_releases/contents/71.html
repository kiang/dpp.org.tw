					<!-- <a class="mailto" href="mailto:?subject=民主進步黨 - Chairman Lai Ching-te's Address at the DPP's Second Assembly of the 20th National Party Congress&body=Today (July 16), the Democratic Progressive Party held the Second Assembly of the 20th National Party Congress. The theme of the assembly was &ldquo;Democratic Unity in Support of Taiwan.&rdquo; Appealing to the DPP administration&rsquo;s governance goals such as: &ldquo;care for the people, education efforts, and economic achievements,&rdquo; and highlighting convenience-for-people measures like monthly tickets for commuting within the three major living circles, the DPP proved that it is well prepared for continued governance.

During the assembly&rsquo;s opening, a 6-minute video showcased a suite of policy achievements the DPP has attained since assuming power that resonate with the people. Voiced over mainly by President Tsai Ing-wen, and later by Chairman Lai Ching-te and former Premier Su Tseng-chang, the video appealed to &ldquo;maintaining the nation&rsquo;s direction and building a better Taiwan.&rdquo;

Full Text of Chairman Lai Ching-te&#39;s Address at the Opening of DPP&#39;s Second Assembly of the 20th National Party Congress：

President Tsai Ing-wen, Premier Chen Chien-jen, former Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, President of the Legislative Yuan You Si-Kun, Majority Leader Ker Chien-ming, the 18 founding members of our party, Central Executive Committee Chairman Lai Jui-lung, Secretary-General Hsu Li-ming, city and county mayors of the DPP-administered cities and counties, all DPP-nominated and Grand Democratic Alliance legislative candidates, distinguished attendees, all party delegates: Good afternoon.

Thank you for attending the 20th National Congress of the Democratic Progressive Party and standing together to support Taiwan at this critical moment.

Next year&#39;s presidential and legislative elections will affect the trajectory of Taiwan&rsquo;s future, the sustainability of our democracy, and hold significance for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. This is why we chose the Grand Hotel, where our party was founded, as the venue for this year&rsquo;s National Congress. Here in this venue of democracy, I will lead our outstanding candidates of the Grand Democratic Alliance, which spans across party lines, multiple generations, and backgrounds, to take a vow. We commemorate our founding members and their courage to fight for democracy in the dark times under an authoritarian dictatorship. We will also show our generation&rsquo;s determination to uphold our party&rsquo;s founding principles and democratic values. We will stand in solidarity to defend Taiwan&rsquo;s sovereignty in the face of external challenges.

Our successes in the past mean failure cannot be an option now. The DPP is a political party born in Taiwan, nurtured by this land, and stands to support Taiwan&#39;s survival, development, and the well-being of the people. We may have various missions during different stages of democracy, yet the core belief remains unchanged: We will always stand for freedom and democracy, diversity, and social justice. We will always stand together with the people of Taiwan.

We must realize that democracy means government by the people. The people have a right to express their expectations as well as their dissatisfaction with the government. This is the belief that our party is founded on and the core value that we uphold.

Therefore, we must welcome critiques of the current administration, for they are an opportunity to examine whether we have met the people&rsquo;s expectations. We should strive to bring together all our people, as they are the masters of our country. Today, there is a rally on Ketagalan Boulevard. This is normal in a democratic society. We must listen to what they say and accept constructive criticism, taking it as fuel for growth and change. When the criticism we receive does not reflect reality, we need to communicate with clarity and sincerity, allowing people to decide on their own. I firmly believe that only with open, democratic governance can we both become stronger as a society and a greater nation.

This is the first time I am hosting our National Congress. I have three points of gratitude I would like to express.

First, I want to thank all fellow party members for showing unity, bravery in overcoming challenges, and the courage to reform. We have never asked anyone to put the party&#39;s interest first because the people&#39;s interest, social progress, and our country&rsquo;s future should always come first. We did not relent in our efforts to reform because of the election; instead, we continued improving our policies, striving to meet the people&#39;s needs. Regardless of whether it was issues relating to academic integrity, black gold, or gender equality, we strove to reform our party&rsquo;s regulations and promote better internal mechanisms. At the same time, we also pushed for legal revisions so that the benefits of reform could be seen by our entire society. This is the DPP&rsquo;s duty here in Taiwan &ndash; it is what we should do. We should never forget that the people&#39;s will always trumps the party&#39;s will. This is what our founding members taught us. This is the core of democratic politics, and the DPP&rsquo;s never changing promise to Taiwanese society.

Second, I am grateful to the people in Taiwan for handing the DPP an opportunity to return to office in 2016, entrusting us with the responsibility to foster change in Taiwan. Looking back, as a member of the administration, I know how the team led by President Tsai continued to work around the clock. From Premier Chen&#39;s words earlier, we can tell that the administration has tackled countless challenges, overcome countless obstacles, and accomplished significant results. We did not fail to live up to the trust the people placed on us. I invite all party members to give the team a big round of applause. Thank you to President Tsai, Premier Chen, former Premier Su, former Premier Lin, and the whole administrative team.

Third, I want to thank our fellow party members for nominating me to be the DPP&rsquo;s presidential candidate. This has been the greatest honor in my life. I know the heavy duty I have ahead of me and dedicate myself to completing our work ahead. I will not let everybody down. I will also build on the foundation laid by President Tsai, bring in talented personnel, and embody our party spirit of &ldquo;Integrity, Diligence, and Love for the Homeland.&rdquo; In so doing, we will confirm our inheritance and move smartly forward with innovation, building a better, more progressive country.

In recent years, in addition to the continuing complexities of the domestic challenges we face, the global landscape has also undergone enormous changes. This includes growing confrontation between democracy and authoritarianism, as well as tectonic shifts in global industries and supply chains. At the same time, digital and net-zero transformations have intensified at a rapid pace. The challenges facing Taiwan will continue to accumulate. I firmly believe that as long as we stand together and are able to take advantage of Taiwan&rsquo;s strengths, we will turn crises into opportunities.

I hereby commit that I will promote the spirit of the Grand Democratic Alliance throughout society. I will bring in talented personnel from different sectors of society to build a &ldquo;National Project of Hope,&rdquo; building a democratic and peaceful Taiwan, an innovative and prosperous Taiwan, and a just and sustainable Taiwan. Together, we will make Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic story shine across the world.

First, on a democratic and peaceful Taiwan:

Taiwan is not part of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. I will continue to unite Taiwanese society under the framework of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Confronted with authoritarian expansionism in the region, we will continue to uphold the Four Commitments, defending the democratic constitutional system and maintaining the status quo. Through the &ldquo;Four Pillars for Peace&rdquo; that I have set out, we will demonstrate to the world Taiwan&rsquo;s determination to pursue democracy and peace.

We will actively improve defensive capabilities and enhance our national security. We will strengthen the importance of supply chains and pursue trade diversification, in order to bolster Taiwan&rsquo;s economic security. We will seek closer partnerships with like-minded countries around the world and work together to build greater deterrence. Under the principles of parity and dignity, as long as it advances the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, we will be willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait ties.

Second, an innovative and prosperous Taiwan:

At the dawn of the intelligence era, our economic vision will be based on innovation-driven growth. We will adopt a whole-of-government approach to promoting digital transformation, invest in next-generation technological innovation, and upgrade Taiwan&rsquo;s economy. As we make strides towards net zero by 2050, we aim to generate new momentum driving green growth. Furthermore, we must sustain Taiwan&rsquo;s lead in the information, communication and semiconductor industries, support the development of more hidden champions into huguo shenshan (mountains that protect the country), and strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s position in the global industrial supply chain. We will promote regional revitalization, support local industries, cultivate social enterprises, and achieve more inclusive growth so everyone can enjoy the fruits of economic development.

Third, a just and sustainable Taiwan:

I was born into an underprivileged family. I am deeply aware that the hope of a country comes from the hope of everyone within it. No one should be left behind. Fairness and social justice can propel the development of a society. Therefore, I will invest in our future generations, ensuring a stronger social safety net for those aged zero to twenty-two, so that they have a fair shot at pursuing their dreams, regardless of socio-economic and family background.

With such a vision, thanks to the leadership of President Tsai and Premier Chen, the administration and I recently worked together on policies seeking to reduce the private-public tuition fee difference and three solutions in support of youth housing. In the future, I will expand the government&#39;s social investments, promoting a new 2.0 plan for providing subsidies to families with children under six, as well as a new 3.0 plan for long-term care. I will ensure that labor rights, gender equality, and the interests of underprivileged groups are protected, upholding our values of diversity and equality. I will also stand firm against organized crime, black gold, illegal firearms, drugs, and scams so as to ensure our society&#39;s justice, safety, and stability.

The &ldquo;National Project of Hope&rdquo; is our vision, ideal, and blueprint for the future governance of our country. Moving forward, I will continue to release policy proposals using different formats and channels.

My fellow citizens and party members, Taiwan is again at the crossroads of democracy and authoritarianism. We have lived through the pain of oppression and enjoyed the blessings of democracy. We can never go backward simply because of the expansion of authoritarianism or its growing coercive actions. We must have the courage to move forward and continue on this path. We must trust that we will continue to become stronger on the path toward democracy.

I have a clear direction, a proven record of execution, and determination. Please grant me the opportunity to lead Taiwan and bear responsibility for our next stage of governance. I will be guided by the beacon of peace and the compass of democracy, charting a way for Taiwan forward through the complexities of geopolitics. For Taiwan to move forward, we also need a strong legislative majority. Please support all the candidates of our Grand Democratic Alliance.

In baseball terms, President Tsai was the best starting pitcher in the last game. And now, I am properly warmed up and have stepped onto the pitcher&#39;s mound, ready to pitch&mdash;please give me some encouragement. Every pitch will take us closer to victory. And our Grand Democratic Alliance candidates, imbued with their ideals, are our batters. Every swing represents hope&mdash;so they need to do their best in order to secure victory. My fellow party members, let us work together to send them all into the Legislative Yuan. Let us win the presidential election and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Let us safeguard Taiwan together. Do we all have the confidence to succeed?

Team Taiwan! Support Taiwan! We are confident that we will lead the people of Taiwan to advance on the international stage, usher in a new future, and bring victory for Taiwan. Let us become the MVPs of the democratic world! Let us encourage one another and work together! Thank you!">

I will also build on the foundation laid by President Tsai, bring in talented personnel, and embody our party spirit of &ldquo;Integrity, Diligence, and Love for the Homeland.&rdquo; In so doing, we will confirm our inheritance and move smartly forward with innovation, building a better, more progressive country.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In recent years, in addition to the continuing complexities of the domestic challenges we face, the global landscape has also undergone enormous changes. This includes growing confrontation between democracy and authoritarianism, as well as tectonic shifts in global industries and supply chains. At the same time, digital and net-zero transformations have intensified at a rapid pace. The challenges facing Taiwan will continue to accumulate. I firmly believe that as long as we stand together and are able to take advantage of Taiwan&rsquo;s strengths, we will turn crises into opportunities.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I hereby commit that I will promote the spirit of the Grand Democratic Alliance throughout society. I will bring in talented personnel from different sectors of society to build a &ldquo;National Project of Hope,&rdquo; building a democratic and peaceful Taiwan, an innovative and prosperous Taiwan, and a just and sustainable Taiwan. Together, we will make Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic story shine across the world.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">First, on a democratic and peaceful Taiwan:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Taiwan is not part of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. I will continue to unite Taiwanese society under the framework of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Confronted with authoritarian expansionism in the region, we will continue to uphold the Four Commitments, defending the democratic constitutional system and maintaining the status quo. Through the &ldquo;Four Pillars for Peace&rdquo; that I have set out, we will demonstrate to the world Taiwan&rsquo;s determination to pursue democracy and peace.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We will actively improve defensive capabilities and enhance our national security. We will strengthen the importance of supply chains and pursue trade diversification, in order to bolster Taiwan&rsquo;s economic security. We will seek closer partnerships with like-minded countries around the world and work together to build greater deterrence. Under the principles of parity and dignity, as long as it advances the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, we will be willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait ties.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Second, an innovative and prosperous Taiwan:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">At the dawn of the intelligence era, our economic vision will be based on innovation-driven growth. We will adopt a whole-of-government approach to promoting digital transformation, invest in next-generation technological innovation, and upgrade Taiwan&rsquo;s economy. As we make strides towards net zero by 2050, we aim to generate new momentum driving green growth. Furthermore, we must sustain Taiwan&rsquo;s lead in the information, communication and semiconductor industries, support the development of more hidden champions into huguo shenshan (mountains that protect the country), and strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s position in the global industrial supply chain. We will promote regional revitalization, support local industries, cultivate social enterprises, and achieve more inclusive growth so everyone can enjoy the fruits of economic development.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Third, a just and sustainable Taiwan:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I was born into an underprivileged family. I am deeply aware that the hope of a country comes from the hope of everyone within it. No one should be left behind. Fairness and social justice can propel the development of a society. Therefore, I will invest in our future generations, ensuring a stronger social safety net for those aged zero to twenty-two, so that they have a fair shot at pursuing their dreams, regardless of socio-economic and family background.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">With such a vision, thanks to the leadership of President Tsai and Premier Chen, the administration and I recently worked together on policies seeking to reduce the private-public tuition fee difference and three solutions in support of youth housing. In the future, I will expand the government&#39;s social investments, promoting a new 2.0 plan for providing subsidies to families with children under six, as well as a new 3.0 plan for long-term care. I will ensure that labor rights, gender equality, and the interests of underprivileged groups are protected, upholding our values of diversity and equality. I will also stand firm against organized crime, black gold, illegal firearms, drugs, and scams so as to ensure our society&#39;s justice, safety, and stability.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The &ldquo;National Project of Hope&rdquo; is our vision, ideal, and blueprint for the future governance of our country. Moving forward, I will continue to release policy proposals using different formats and channels.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">My fellow citizens and party members, Taiwan is again at the crossroads of democracy and authoritarianism. We have lived through the pain of oppression and enjoyed the blessings of democracy. We can never go backward simply because of the expansion of authoritarianism or its growing coercive actions. We must have the courage to move forward and continue on this path. We must trust that we will continue to become stronger on the path toward democracy.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I have a clear direction, a proven record of execution, and determination. Please grant me the opportunity to lead Taiwan and bear responsibility for our next stage of governance. I will be guided by the beacon of peace and the compass of democracy, charting a way for Taiwan forward through the complexities of geopolitics. For Taiwan to move forward, we also need a strong legislative majority. Please support all the candidates of our Grand Democratic Alliance.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In baseball terms, President Tsai was the best starting pitcher in the last game. And now, I am properly warmed up and have stepped onto the pitcher&#39;s mound, ready to pitch&mdash;please give me some encouragement. Every pitch will take us closer to victory. And our Grand Democratic Alliance candidates, imbued with their ideals, are our batters. Every swing represents hope&mdash;so they need to do their best in order to secure victory. My fellow party members, let us work together to send them all into the Legislative Yuan. Let us win the presidential election and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Let us safeguard Taiwan together. Do we all have the confidence to succeed?</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Team Taiwan! Support Taiwan! We are confident that we will lead the people of Taiwan to advance on the international stage, usher in a new future, and bring victory for Taiwan. Let us become the MVPs of the democratic world! Let us encourage one another and work together! Thank you!</span></span></p>

					<!-- <a class="mailto" href="mailto:?subject=民主進步黨 - Chairman Lai Ching-te's Address at the DPP's Second Assembly of the 20th National Party Congress&body=Today (July 16), the Democratic Progressive Party held the Second Assembly of the 20th National Party Congress. The theme of the assembly was &ldquo;Democratic Unity in Support of Taiwan.&rdquo; Appealing to the DPP administration&rsquo;s governance goals such as: &ldquo;care for the people, education efforts, and economic achievements,&rdquo; and highlighting convenience-for-people measures like monthly tickets for commuting within the three major living circles, the DPP proved that it is well prepared for continued governance.

During the assembly&rsquo;s opening, a 6-minute video showcased a suite of policy achievements the DPP has attained since assuming power that resonate with the people. Voiced over mainly by President Tsai Ing-wen, and later by Chairman Lai Ching-te and former Premier Su Tseng-chang, the video appealed to &ldquo;maintaining the nation&rsquo;s direction and building a better Taiwan.&rdquo;

Full Text of Chairman Lai Ching-te&#39;s Address at the Opening of DPP&#39;s Second Assembly of the 20th National Party Congress：

President Tsai Ing-wen, Premier Chen Chien-jen, former Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, President of the Legislative Yuan You Si-Kun, Majority Leader Ker Chien-ming, the 18 founding members of our party, Central Executive Committee Chairman Lai Jui-lung, Secretary-General Hsu Li-ming, city and county mayors of the DPP-administered cities and counties, all DPP-nominated and Grand Democratic Alliance legislative candidates, distinguished attendees, all party delegates: Good afternoon.

Thank you for attending the 20th National Congress of the Democratic Progressive Party and standing together to support Taiwan at this critical moment.

Next year&#39;s presidential and legislative elections will affect the trajectory of Taiwan&rsquo;s future, the sustainability of our democracy, and hold significance for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. This is why we chose the Grand Hotel, where our party was founded, as the venue for this year&rsquo;s National Congress. Here in this venue of democracy, I will lead our outstanding candidates of the Grand Democratic Alliance, which spans across party lines, multiple generations, and backgrounds, to take a vow. We commemorate our founding members and their courage to fight for democracy in the dark times under an authoritarian dictatorship. We will also show our generation&rsquo;s determination to uphold our party&rsquo;s founding principles and democratic values. We will stand in solidarity to defend Taiwan&rsquo;s sovereignty in the face of external challenges.

Our successes in the past mean failure cannot be an option now. The DPP is a political party born in Taiwan, nurtured by this land, and stands to support Taiwan&#39;s survival, development, and the well-being of the people. We may have various missions during different stages of democracy, yet the core belief remains unchanged: We will always stand for freedom and democracy, diversity, and social justice. We will always stand together with the people of Taiwan.

We must realize that democracy means government by the people. The people have a right to express their expectations as well as their dissatisfaction with the government. This is the belief that our party is founded on and the core value that we uphold.

Therefore, we must welcome critiques of the current administration, for they are an opportunity to examine whether we have met the people&rsquo;s expectations. We should strive to bring together all our people, as they are the masters of our country. Today, there is a rally on Ketagalan Boulevard. This is normal in a democratic society. We must listen to what they say and accept constructive criticism, taking it as fuel for growth and change. When the criticism we receive does not reflect reality, we need to communicate with clarity and sincerity, allowing people to decide on their own. I firmly believe that only with open, democratic governance can we both become stronger as a society and a greater nation.

This is the first time I am hosting our National Congress. I have three points of gratitude I would like to express.

First, I want to thank all fellow party members for showing unity, bravery in overcoming challenges, and the courage to reform. We have never asked anyone to put the party&#39;s interest first because the people&#39;s interest, social progress, and our country&rsquo;s future should always come first. We did not relent in our efforts to reform because of the election; instead, we continued improving our policies, striving to meet the people&#39;s needs. Regardless of whether it was issues relating to academic integrity, black gold, or gender equality, we strove to reform our party&rsquo;s regulations and promote better internal mechanisms. At the same time, we also pushed for legal revisions so that the benefits of reform could be seen by our entire society. This is the DPP&rsquo;s duty here in Taiwan &ndash; it is what we should do. We should never forget that the people&#39;s will always trumps the party&#39;s will. This is what our founding members taught us. This is the core of democratic politics, and the DPP&rsquo;s never changing promise to Taiwanese society.

Second, I am grateful to the people in Taiwan for handing the DPP an opportunity to return to office in 2016, entrusting us with the responsibility to foster change in Taiwan. Looking back, as a member of the administration, I know how the team led by President Tsai continued to work around the clock. From Premier Chen&#39;s words earlier, we can tell that the administration has tackled countless challenges, overcome countless obstacles, and accomplished significant results. We did not fail to live up to the trust the people placed on us. I invite all party members to give the team a big round of applause. Thank you to President Tsai, Premier Chen, former Premier Su, former Premier Lin, and the whole administrative team.

Third, I want to thank our fellow party members for nominating me to be the DPP&rsquo;s presidential candidate. This has been the greatest honor in my life. I know the heavy duty I have ahead of me and dedicate myself to completing our work ahead. I will not let everybody down. I will also build on the foundation laid by President Tsai, bring in talented personnel, and embody our party spirit of &ldquo;Integrity, Diligence, and Love for the Homeland.&rdquo; In so doing, we will confirm our inheritance and move smartly forward with innovation, building a better, more progressive country.

In recent years, in addition to the continuing complexities of the domestic challenges we face, the global landscape has also undergone enormous changes. This includes growing confrontation between democracy and authoritarianism, as well as tectonic shifts in global industries and supply chains. At the same time, digital and net-zero transformations have intensified at a rapid pace. The challenges facing Taiwan will continue to accumulate. I firmly believe that as long as we stand together and are able to take advantage of Taiwan&rsquo;s strengths, we will turn crises into opportunities.

I hereby commit that I will promote the spirit of the Grand Democratic Alliance throughout society. I will bring in talented personnel from different sectors of society to build a &ldquo;National Project of Hope,&rdquo; building a democratic and peaceful Taiwan, an innovative and prosperous Taiwan, and a just and sustainable Taiwan. Together, we will make Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic story shine across the world.

First, on a democratic and peaceful Taiwan:

I was born into an underprivileged family. I am deeply aware that the hope of a country comes from the hope of everyone within it. No one should be left behind. Fairness and social justice can propel the development of a society. Therefore, I will invest in our future generations, ensuring a stronger social safety net for those aged zero to twenty-two, so that they have a fair shot at pursuing their dreams, regardless of socio-economic and family background.

The &ldquo;National Project of Hope&rdquo; is our vision, ideal, and blueprint for the future governance of our country. Moving forward, I will continue to release policy proposals using different formats and channels.

My fellow citizens and party members, Taiwan is again at the crossroads of democracy and authoritarianism. We have lived through the pain of oppression and enjoyed the blessings of democracy.

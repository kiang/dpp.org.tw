					<!-- <a class="mailto" href="mailto:?subject=民主進步黨 - Democracies around the World Condemn the CCP's Military Exercises Surrounding Taiwan &body=The CCP&#39;s large-scale military exercises and launch of ballistic missiles near Taiwan have sparked international controversy, leading democracies around the world to condemn China in unison. DPP Spokesperson Peifen Hsieh stated today (5th) that from the reactions of the United States, Japan, the European Union (EU), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, and other countries, it can be seen that the world disapproved the CCP&#39;s action of conducting military exercises on the busiest air routes and waterways in the name of the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi&#39;s visit to Taiwan.

Spokesperson Hsieh said that regarding Pelosi&#39;s visit to Taiwan, the US executive branch and Congress expressed unanimous support and could not agree with China&#39;s strong response. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby stated, &quot;China has chosen to overreact and use the Speaker&#39;s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait.&quot; He criticized China&#39;s actions as &quot;creating a crisis&quot; and attempting to change the status quo. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized, &quot;Nothing has changed about our position (to Taiwan)... We, and countries around the world, believe that escalation serves no one and could have unintended consequences that serve no one&#39;s interests, including ASEAN members and including China. We&#39;ve reached out to engage our PRC counterparts in recent days at every level of government to convey this message. &quot;

US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez and Republican Ranking Member Jim Risch also issued a joint statement criticizing Beijing for conducting &quot;dangerous and provocative&quot; live-fire exercises around Taiwan, saying that these large-scale military exercises are equivalent to a blockade of Taiwan. Republican Senator Rick Scott, who just visited Taiwan last month, also stated, &quot;Xi is showing the world exactly what he plans to do when he attempts to take Taiwan by force, but the United States will never be intimidated by weak, overly-sensitive dictators. No American is going to be intimidated by Xi or allow his threats to weaken our resolve to support democracy in Taiwan and security in the Indo-Pacific.&quot; House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted that the Chinese military&#39;s reckless drills would only worsen the situation and urged Beijing to stop military exercises immediately.

Spokesperson Hsieh stated that after China started military exercises, Japan, which is geographically closest to Taiwan, bore the brunt. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida strongly condemned the launch of Chinese missiles into Japan&#39;s exclusive economic zone and called China to stop military exercises. After today&#39;s meeting between Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Speaker Pelosi, he said that Japan would continue to cooperate with the US to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait jointly. Japan&#39;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Yoshimasa Hayashi also stated that the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait are indispensable to the security and prosperity of the international community. Japan expressed great concern about the series of military actions announced by China and expected the issue to be resolved peacefully through dialogue.&nbsp;

In addition, Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO, also stated that Pelosi&#39;s visit to Taiwan is not a reason for China to overreact and threaten Taiwan, seeing that several high-level officials from the US and NATO allies also have visited Taiwan in the past. Josep Borrell, the EU&#39;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, also tweeted, condemning China for &quot;using a visit as a pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.&quot; Moreover, the ten countries of ASEAN, which were holding a meeting of Foreign Ministers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, also issued a statement calling on all parties to exercise restraint and refrain from provocative actions.

Spokesperson Hsieh further explained that apart from the statements made by the United States, Japan, and other vital organizations, some major democratic countries in the world have also voiced their solidarity with Taiwan.

Jean-Louis Bourlanges, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, stated that Taiwanese citizens have the right to live freely on their territory and receive guests of their choice. The difference between Taiwan and China is &quot;the right of people to live in a democracy,&quot; a core value that cannot be compromised. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss criticized Beijing&#39;s harsh response and stated Speaker Pelosi was &quot;well within her rights&quot; to visit Taiwan, urging China to de-escalate. Canadian Foreign Minister M&eacute;lanie Joly said that Canada is extremely worried about the current situation. She said, &quot;We call on China to de-escalate because we think that there may be risks of not only heightened tensions but also destabilizing the region.&quot; Similarly, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong also called for the fragile status quo in the Taiwan Strait to be maintained and asked all sides to take action to reduce tensions.

Spokesperson Hsieh emphasized that the CCP has repeatedly threatened and harassed Taiwan. Now, it has even chosen to conduct military exercises on the busiest shipping routes and waterways in the world, undermining the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. This act is not acceptable to global democracy. As a part of democracy in the world, Taiwan is grateful for the support of other allies and calls on the CCP to face up to the positions and demands of these countries.">

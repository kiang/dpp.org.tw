					<!-- <a class="mailto" href="mailto:?subject=民主進步黨 - Acceptance Speech of Lai Ching-te in DPP 2024 Presidential Election Nomination Press Conference&body=My fellow citizens, distinguished Party members, friends from the media, good afternoon. 

It is my honor to be nominated by the Democratic Progressive Party to shoulder the responsibility as the candidate for the Presidential election in 2024. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the members of the Central Executive Committee, and members of the DPP for your trust and support.

Last week, as President Tsai embarked on her overseas trip, former President Ma also traveled to China. The two trips could not have been more different in their significance and the values they reflect. Former President Ma intended to re-subject Taiwan to the One China framework. President Tsai, meanwhile, marched toward a democratic and international future. These are two markedly different paths for our country&rsquo;s future after 2024.

The election next year will determine Taiwan&rsquo;s future, the continuation of our democratic system, the welfare of our future generations, and the stability and peace of the Indo-Pacific region. As such, I hereby commit: I will lead all the DPP candidates in the legislative election, unite forces for progress in our society, and do everything in my power to win the support of the people, accomplishing the ultimate objectives for 2024. These include: first, a landslide victory in the presidential election; second, a simple majority in the Legislature. And with the stabilizing democratic force flowing from these achievements, we will practice Democratic Unity, Democratic Governance and Democratic Peace, to construct a nation brimming with hope and achieve our goals of democracy, prosperity and peace.

The first initiative is &ldquo;Democratic Unity.&rdquo; We will build a democratic community and unite the country. 

Taiwan has its own territory and citizens. It holds regular elections on all levels of government with a mandate to serve the people. It is, in fact, already a sovereign nation, with no need to declare independence. In addition, the Republic of China and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China are not subordinate to one another. Naturally, Taiwan is not part of &ldquo;the PRC&rsquo;s sacred and unalienable territory.&rdquo; Taiwan&rsquo;s sovereignty is inviolable, and the future of the Republic of China (Taiwan) can only be determined by the 23 million people thereof.

As multiple election polls show, the vast majority of Taiwanese people oppose unification, nor do they accept the &ldquo;One China Principle,&rdquo; &ldquo;1992 Consensus&rdquo; or &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems.&rdquo; 

In other words, according to the facts and mainstream public opinion, Taiwan has no issue of unification versus independence.

Democracy is the broadest consensus among the people of Taiwan. Only by continuing to bolster the Republic of China (Taiwan) and safeguarding the status quo of freedom and democracy will we be on the right path.&nbsp; I will work to rally our people, foster Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic community, and unite our country to calmly face authoritarian intimidation and challenges from within and without.

Clearly, the 2024 election is not a choice between &ldquo;war&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace,&rdquo; but one between &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;authoritarianism.&rdquo; I invite the people of Taiwan to once again vote for democracy, solidify democracy, unite our country and reject returning to the authoritarian past.

The second initiative is &ldquo;Democratic Governance,&rdquo; which means to build an open government, and foster a resilient and prosperous Taiwan.

I have always believed that democracy means government by the people. We not only have to protect civil rights; we must increase civic participation in national development, so we can build a more advanced and beautiful country together.

So, in the future, I will steadfastly practice democratic governance, and facilitate an open government based on the spirit of transparency and government by the people. And through citizens&rsquo; participation, we will create opportunities for communities with diverse interests to convene and address complex issues. Through this bottom-up approach to governance, we can solidify Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic resilience.

I will also strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s economic resilience to tackle climate change, changes in geopolitics, and challenges posed by the post-pandemic era. We must continue improving Taiwan&#39;s investment environment, applying to join regional economic arrangements and reaching trade or investment agreements. We will enter, and maintain our position in, global supply chains to enable Taiwanese companies to take root in Taiwan, expand globally and market to the world.

We should also carefully develop emerging technologies such as AIoT and push for the industrialization and incorporation of AI, to further bolster Taiwan&rsquo;s technology industry. To bring prosperity and progress to Taiwanese society, we need to facilitate the digitization of small and mid-size businesses and their transition to net-zero emissions; abide by ESG sustainability principles; boost Taiwan&rsquo;s competitiveness; ensure small and mid-size businesses can achieve stable growth; and guarantee workers&rsquo; livelihoods. 

Moving forward, we must strengthen equal development in all areas of Taiwan. Through deepening collaboration between central and local governments, and establishing regional collaborative platforms, we can resolve local issues and build a better living environment. At the same time, through fostering regional revitalization, encouraging youth entrepreneurship, supporting local businesses, developing social enterprises, and creating more employment opportunities, we can build a Taiwan where everyone can live with security&ndash;and thrive.

The final initiative is &ldquo;Democratic Peace.&rdquo; That is, showcase the vibrancy of democracy, while working alongside like-minded nations to peacefully protect Taiwan.

I must emphasize: Peace is invaluable, and there are no winners in war. China must realize that while a cross-strait war will strike Taiwan most directly, it will not be spared the ensuing global catastrophe, either. We both must exercise caution. 

A proverb warns: Do not delude yourself that enemies will not come; we must await their arrival fully prepared. Until China renounces the use of force against Taiwan, we must continue to strengthen civil and national defense. We must fully prepare to resist a Chinese incursion and protect Taiwan. The global democratic camp is already keenly aware of the China threat, and recognizes the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan should work in unison with like-minded democratic partners to form an effective deterrence against China so that it does not take reckless action. Only by preparing for war can we avoid one; only with the ability to fight a war can we stop one. Only strength can bring peace.

The DPP has fought for democracy in the past, and will fight for peace in the future. In the face of China&rsquo;s threats and intimidation, we will not change our stance on peace, nor will we relinquish any opportunities for peace. We will uphold the principles of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;dignity&rdquo; to confidently conduct cross-strait exchange and cooperation, in order to take a step toward mutual understanding, reconciliation, and jointly working for the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We can then face the challenges of natural disasters and new transmittable diseases together, achieving cross-strait peace through cooperation.

Globally, the population of the Indo-Pacific region has exceeded four billion, and accounts for 60% of the world&rsquo;s GDP. It is the region with the fastest economic development in the world, and will be most severely affected by geopolitical changes.

Taiwan occupies a crucial position in the first island chain, and is therefore vital to the stability and development of the Indo-Pacific region and world.

Taiwan needs to proactively play a key role in the development of the Indo-Pacific region, display the vibrancy of democracy and deepen our democratic alliances. Other than regional security collaboration, we must use our democratic values, experience in public health, position in semiconductor industrial chains, as well as achievements such as our religious freedom, athletic exchanges, youth services and academic research to, alongside like-minded countries, build a commonwealth of democratic peace to preserve peace in the Taiwan Strait, Indo-Pacific and world.

Fellow citizens, under the leadership of President Tsai Ing-wen, the world has seen Taiwan and recognized our importance. In the future, I will walk the same democratic path and continue to strengthen a democratic Taiwan. Let the world see the value of Taiwan, and embrace Taiwan.

Taiwan is the Most Valuable Player of the democratic world.
Let&rsquo;s encourage one another and work together.">

					<!-- <a class="mailto" href="mailto:?subject=民主進步黨 - Acceptance Speech of Lai Ching-te in DPP 2024 Presidential Election Nomination Press Conference&body=My fellow citizens, distinguished Party members, friends from the media, good afternoon. 

It is my honor to be nominated by the Democratic Progressive Party to shoulder the responsibility as the candidate for the Presidential election in 2024. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the members of the Central Executive Committee, and members of the DPP for your trust and support.

Last week, as President Tsai embarked on her overseas trip, former President Ma also traveled to China. The two trips could not have been more different in their significance and the values they reflect. Former President Ma intended to re-subject Taiwan to the One China framework. President Tsai, meanwhile, marched toward a democratic and international future. These are two markedly different paths for our country&rsquo;s future after 2024.

The election next year will determine Taiwan&rsquo;s future, the continuation of our democratic system, the welfare of our future generations, and the stability and peace of the Indo-Pacific region. As such, I hereby commit: I will lead all the DPP candidates in the legislative election, unite forces for progress in our society, and do everything in my power to win the support of the people, accomplishing the ultimate objectives for 2024. These include: first, a landslide victory in the presidential election; second, a simple majority in the Legislature. And with the stabilizing democratic force flowing from these achievements, we will practice Democratic Unity, Democratic Governance and Democratic Peace, to construct a nation brimming with hope and achieve our goals of democracy, prosperity and peace.

The first initiative is &ldquo;Democratic Unity.&rdquo; We will build a democratic community and unite the country. 

Taiwan has its own territory and citizens. It holds regular elections on all levels of government with a mandate to serve the people. It is, in fact, already a sovereign nation, with no need to declare independence. In addition, the Republic of China and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China are not subordinate to one another. Naturally, Taiwan is not part of &ldquo;the PRC&rsquo;s sacred and unalienable territory.&rdquo; Taiwan&rsquo;s sovereignty is inviolable, and the future of the Republic of China (Taiwan) can only be determined by the 23 million people thereof.

As multiple election polls show, the vast majority of Taiwanese people oppose unification, nor do they accept the &ldquo;One China Principle,&rdquo; &ldquo;1992 Consensus&rdquo; or &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems.&rdquo; 

In other words, according to the facts and mainstream public opinion, Taiwan has no issue of unification versus independence.

Democracy is the broadest consensus among the people of Taiwan. Only by continuing to bolster the Republic of China (Taiwan) and safeguarding the status quo of freedom and democracy will we be on the right path.&nbsp; I will work to rally our people, foster Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic community, and unite our country to calmly face authoritarian intimidation and challenges from within and without.

Clearly, the 2024 election is not a choice between &ldquo;war&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace,&rdquo; but one between &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;authoritarianism.&rdquo; I invite the people of Taiwan to once again vote for democracy, solidify democracy, unite our country and reject returning to the authoritarian past.

The second initiative is &ldquo;Democratic Governance,&rdquo; which means to build an open government, and foster a resilient and prosperous Taiwan.

I have always believed that democracy means government by the people. We not only have to protect civil rights; we must increase civic participation in national development, so we can build a more advanced and beautiful country together.

So, in the future, I will steadfastly practice democratic governance, and facilitate an open government based on the spirit of transparency and government by the people. And through citizens&rsquo; participation, we will create opportunities for communities with diverse interests to convene and address complex issues. Through this bottom-up approach to governance, we can solidify Taiwan&rsquo;s democratic resilience.

I will also strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s economic resilience to tackle climate change, changes in geopolitics, and challenges posed by the post-pandemic era. We must continue improving Taiwan&#39;s investment environment, applying to join regional economic arrangements and reaching trade or investment agreements. We will enter, and maintain our position in, global supply chains to enable Taiwanese companies to take root in Taiwan, expand globally and market to the world.

We should also carefully develop emerging technologies such as AIoT and push for the industrialization and incorporation of AI, to further bolster Taiwan&rsquo;s technology industry. To bring prosperity and progress to Taiwanese society, we need to facilitate the digitization of small and mid-size businesses and their transition to net-zero emissions; abide by ESG sustainability principles; boost Taiwan&rsquo;s competitiveness; ensure small and mid-size businesses can achieve stable growth; and guarantee workers&rsquo; livelihoods. 

Moving forward, we must strengthen equal development in all areas of Taiwan. Through deepening collaboration between central and local governments, and establishing regional collaborative platforms, we can resolve local issues and build a better living environment. At the same time, through fostering regional revitalization, encouraging youth entrepreneurship, supporting local businesses, developing social enterprises, and creating more employment opportunities, we can build a Taiwan where everyone can live with security&ndash;and thrive.

The final initiative is &ldquo;Democratic Peace.&rdquo; That is, showcase the vibrancy of democracy, while working alongside like-minded nations to peacefully protect Taiwan.

I must emphasize: Peace is invaluable, and there are no winners in war. China must realize that while a cross-strait war will strike Taiwan most directly, it will not be spared the ensuing global catastrophe, either. We both must exercise caution. 

A proverb warns: Do not delude yourself that enemies will not come; we must await their arrival fully prepared. Until China renounces the use of force against Taiwan, we must continue to strengthen civil and national defense. We must fully prepare to resist a Chinese incursion and protect Taiwan. The global democratic camp is already keenly aware of the China threat, and recognizes the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan should work in unison with like-minded democratic partners to form an effective deterrence against China so that it does not take reckless action. Only by preparing for war can we avoid one; only with the ability to fight a war can we stop one. Only strength can bring peace.

The DPP has fought for democracy in the past, and will fight for peace in the future. In the face of China&rsquo;s threats and intimidation, we will not change our stance on peace, nor will we relinquish any opportunities for peace. We will uphold the principles of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; and &ldquo;dignity&rdquo; to confidently conduct cross-strait exchange and cooperation, in order to take a step toward mutual understanding, reconciliation, and jointly working for the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We can then face the challenges of natural disasters and new transmittable diseases together, achieving cross-strait peace through cooperation.

Globally, the population of the Indo-Pacific region has exceeded four billion, and accounts for 60% of the world&rsquo;s GDP. It is the region with the fastest economic development in the world, and will be most severely affected by geopolitical changes.

Taiwan occupies a crucial position in the first island chain, and is therefore vital to the stability and development of the Indo-Pacific region and world.

Taiwan needs to proactively play a key role in the development of the Indo-Pacific region, display the vibrancy of democracy and deepen our democratic alliances. Other than regional security collaboration, we must use our democratic values, experience in public health, position in semiconductor industrial chains, as well as achievements such as our religious freedom, athletic exchanges, youth services and academic research to, alongside like-minded countries, build a commonwealth of democratic peace to preserve peace in the Taiwan Strait, Indo-Pacific and world.

Fellow citizens, under the leadership of President Tsai Ing-wen, the world has seen Taiwan and recognized our importance. In the future, I will walk the same democratic path and continue to strengthen a democratic Taiwan. Let the world see the value of Taiwan, and embrace Taiwan.

Taiwan is the Most Valuable Player of the democratic world.
Let&rsquo;s encourage one another and work together.
